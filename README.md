Hi There! I tried to create a MacBook-like interactive element that can be used as a design element on any web page.I used some layers, that to get effect opening top case, switching screens and touch bar.  I have implemented a simple toggle between dark and light themes on hover to page elements. If you are looking for something to same for your project and now reading this, please give me feedback, what you think about this animation. Maybe I can improve something thanks to your opinion.
